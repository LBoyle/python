# Interfacing with Postgres

Just wanted to go over some Python stuff, I really like Flask and I want to learn it well.

This is just figuring out how to interface Flask with PostgreSQL, using SQLAlchemy, Alembic and flask_migrate.

I'm looking forward to learning more about this stuff, right now, for instance, I have to comment one or other of the lines at the bottom of the app.py file if I want to do a migration or run the server.
